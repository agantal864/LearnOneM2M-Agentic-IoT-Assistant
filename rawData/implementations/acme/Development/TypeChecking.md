# Type Checking

The CSE code is statically type-checked with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org).

Just execute the `mypy` command in the project's root directory and make sure that the [mypy.ini](https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE/tree/master/mypy.ini) file is present. The configuration file contains the setting for the type-checking process.

Run mypy in the project's root directory

```
mypy
```
