# Plugins

This section provides an overview of how to create and manage plugins for the ACME CSE. Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of the CSE without modifying its core codebase.

## Introduction

Plugins can be used to add new features, modify existing behavior, or integrate with external systems. They can interact with the CSE's internal APIs and lifecycle events to provide seamless extensions. Plugins have a well-defined lifecycle, including initialization, configuration, activation, deactivation, and cleanup phases.

Plugins are standard Python modules that are placed in a *plugins* directory within the CSE's base directory. The CSE automatically loads and integrates these plugins at startup. They are loaded in the Python module namespace `acme.plugins.<plugin_name>`. Plugins are loaded and processed in alphabetical case-insensitive order based on their filenames.

### Plugin Directories

There are two locations where the CSE looks for plugins:

* The internal *plugins* directory located within the CSE installation path at `acme/plugins`. This directory is used for plugins that are bundled with the CSE. You should **not** modify or add plugins to this directory, as they may be overwritten during CSE updates.
* The external *plugins* directory located in the CSE's base directory (the directory from which the CSE is started or specified with the [--base-directory](../../setup/Running/#different-base-directory)  command line option). This directory is intended for user-defined plugins.

Even if these are two different directories, they are treated equally by the CSE. Plugins from both directories are loaded and managed in the same way. The only (runtime) difference is the order in which they are loaded: Plugins from the internal directory are loaded first, followed by plugins from the external directory. This means that plugins in the external directory can override plugins with the same name in the internal directory, but only if this is allowed by the configuration setting described in the next section.

### Replacing Loaded Plugins

All plugins are loaded under the same Python module namespace `acme.plugins` and must therefore all have unique names. If there are plugins with the same name in both directories, a Python Exception will be raised during CSE startup. This behaviour can be changed by setting the configuration option [[cse.operation.plugins].replace](../../setup/Configuration-cse/#plugins) to `true`.

### Disabling Plugins

Plugins can be disabled by adding them to the configuration option [[cse.operation.plugins].disabledPlugins](../../setup/Configuration-cse/#plugins). Plugins listed in this configuration setting will not be loaded by the CSE at startup.

Names of disabled plugins must match the plugin module name (i.e., the filename without the `.py` extension). Simple wildcard patterns (e.g., `MyPlugin*`) can be used to disable multiple plugins at once.

Example Configuration to Disable Plugins

```
[cse.operation.plugins]
disabledPlugins = APlugin,MyPlugin*, AnotherPlugin
```

## Developing an Example Plugin

The programming language for plugins is Python, the same as for the ACME CSE itself. To create a new plugin, follow the following steps. We will create a simple example plugin that will log a message when the CSE starts up and shuts down.

### Creating a Plugin Module

Create a new Python module in the `plugins` folder of your working directory.

For example, if your plugin is named `HelloWorld`, create a file named `HelloWorld.py` in the `plugins` directory.

### Writing the Plugin Code

In your plugin module, you need to define a class that is decorated with `@PluginManager.runnableClass`. This class will contain methods that are decorated to hook into the CSE's lifecycle events.

| HelloWorld.py | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ``` | ``` from acme.helpers import PluginManager from acme.runtime.Logging import Logging as L  @PluginManager.pluginClass class HelloWorldPlugin:      @PluginManager.init     def init(self) -> None:         L.log('HelloWorld plugin initialized')      @PluginManager.finish     def finish(self) -> None:         L.log('HelloWorld plugin finished')      @PluginManager.start     def start(self) -> None:         L.log('Hello, world!')      @PluginManager.stop     def stop(self) -> None:         L.log('Goodbye, world!') ``` |

In this example, the `HelloWorld` class is decorated with `@PluginManager.pluginClass`, indicating that it is a plugin class. There can only be one plugin class per plugin module.

The class has four methods that are decorated to hook into the CSE's lifecycle events: `init`, `finish`, `start`, and `stop`. Each method logs a message to the ACME logging system when the CSE starts up and shuts down.

### Running the Plugin

To run the plugin, start or restart the ACME CSE with the working directory containing your `plugins` folder. You should see log messages indicating that the plugin has been initialized and started. When you shutdown the CSE, you should see log messages indicating that the plugin has been stopped and finished.

The log output should look similar to the following:

ACME CSE Log Output

```
...
INFO    MainThread - HelloWorld plugin initialized              HelloWorld.py:9
INFO    MainThread - Hello, world!                              HelloWorld.py:17
...
INFO    MainThread - Goodbye, world!                            HelloWorld.py:21
INFO    MainThread - HelloWorld plugin finished                 HelloWorld.py:13
...
```

## Plugin Lifecycle & API

Plugins in the ACME CSE follow the same lifecycle as the CSE itself, consisting of several phases
that are shown in the following diagram.

```
---
title: Plugin Lifecycle
---
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    [*] --> Initialization
    Initialization --> Configuration 
    Configuration --> Validation
    Validation --> Running
    Running --> Restarting
    Restarting --> Running
    Running --> Stopped
    Stopped --> Running
    Stopped --> Finalization
    Finalization --> [*]
```

The phases of the plugin lifecycle are implemented as methods within the plugin class, each decorated with specific decorators provided by the `PluginManager`. A plugin can implement none, some, or all of the lifecycle methods.

Plugins run in the same thread as the main CSE process, so be careful not to block the main thread within plugin methods. If you need to perform long-running tasks, consider using separate threads or asynchronous programming techniques.

### Initialization

The plugin is loaded and initialized when the CSE starts. The `@PluginManager.init` decorated method is called during this phase.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.init` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.init
def init(self) -> None:
    ...
```

### Configuration

The plugin can read configuration settings from the CSE's configuration file during this phase. The `@PluginManager.configure` decorated method is called during this phase with the `acme.runtime.Configuration.Configuration` object as an argument. This method should raise an exception if required configuration settings are missing or invalid.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.configure` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.configure
def configure(self, config: Configuration) -> None:
    ...
```

### Validation

The plugin can validate its configuration settings during this phase. The `@PluginManager.validate` decorated method is called during this phase with the `acme.runtime.Configuration.Configuration` object as an argument, and therefore has access to ACME's configuration settings. This method should raise an exception if the configuration is invalid.

This phase occurs after configuration and before activation. The plugin can use this phase to ensure that all necessary configuration settings are present and inline with other configuration settings.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.validate` method should be as follows:

```
@PluginManager.validate
def validate(self, config: Configuration) -> None:
    ...
```

### Running

The plugin becomes active and starts performing its intended functions. The `@PluginManager.start` decorated method is called during this phase.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.start` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.start
def start(self) -> None:
    ...
```

### Stopped

The plugin is deactivated and stops performing its functions. The `@PluginManager.stop` decorated method is called during this phase.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.stop` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.stop
def stop(self) -> None:
    ...
```

### Restarting

If the CSE is restarted internally, the plugin's `@PluginManager.restart` decorated method is called. This allows the plugin to reinitialize any state or resources as needed. After this method is called, the plugin is considered to be in the running state again. However, neither the `@PluginManager.start` nor `@PluginManager.stop` methods are called during a restart.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.restart` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.restart
def restart(self) -> None:
    ...
```

### Finalization

The plugin is finalized and cleaned up when the CSE shuts down. The `@PluginManager.finish` decorated method is called during this phase. This is the last phase of the plugin's lifecycle.

The signature of the `@PluginManager.finish` method is as follows:

```
@PluginManager.finish
def finish(self) -> None:
    ...
```
