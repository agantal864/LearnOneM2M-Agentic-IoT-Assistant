Phase 1	The Lab	Setup Python, UV environment, and ACME CSE.	✅ Done
Phase 2	The Library	Vectorize oneM2M PDFs into ChromaDB (RAG).	✅ Done
Phase 3	The Brain	Create the "Professor" logic with strict coding rules.	✅ Done
Phase 4	The Face	Build the Streamlit UI with streaming and session history.	✅ Done
Phase 5	The Hands	System Integration: Turn the Chatbot into an Agent.	Current
Phase 6	The Exam	Final testing, edge-case handling, and refinement.	⏳ Next
Task 5.1: The "Dynamic Requester" Tool

Instead of hardcoded pings, create a tool that can send GET/POST/PUT requests based on LLM reasoning.

Task 5.2: The Routing Logic (Level 3)

Teach the Professor to decide: "Do I need to look at my PDF Library (Theory) or use my Request Tool (Action)?"

Task 5.3: Error Reflection

If a request fails (e.g., 404), the Agent reads the error and explains to the student WHY it failed using the spec context.

Task 5.4: UI Tool Visualization

Add a "Terminal View" in Streamlit sidebar so you can see the raw HTTP traffic the Agent is sending.
